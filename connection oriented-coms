TRANSPORT LAYER BASICS

connection oriented-coms

sender sends request to sync
comp2 acknowledges and negotiation occurs for connection
comp2 syncs back
comp1 ACK
established connection
data transfer
machines 1 and 2 will check connection through protocol software



COMMS arent smooth

assume a bottleneckof infor floods in all at once, 
buffer area created in memory for small burst
too many or large bursts cause flood capacity overrun
flooding causes deleted datagrams

a "not-ready" indication can be sent tyo sender of flood
receiver processes datagram info and then tells sender "ready"

if ther datagrams are out of order or not numerically linear a failure aoccurs
to fix this have the reciving host send out an acknowledgement of every datagram

WINDOWING
speed is slow if you have to do each segment of data
after sending forst segment, sending machine has downtime waiting for ack

WINDOW is the quantity of segments the sender is allowed to recievbe in its window period waiting for ack
protocols can be - number of bytes or number of packets, 
ack with retransmission


sending comp sends and starts a timer, if no ack within time frame packets resent

comp1 sends 1,2,3
ack from comp2
comp1 sends 456
ack from comp2 onmly for 4,6 packet
comp1 sends 5 comp2 ack 5
